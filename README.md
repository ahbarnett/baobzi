# Baobzi
An adaptive fast function approximator based on tree recursion

## Why Baobzi?
It's a cute version of baobab, or the tree of life, which is already a very popular project
name. The baobab lives an extraordinarily long time, which this interpolator is designed to
do. Plant it, and use it again and again. That's about the extent of the metaphor -- try not to
think about it too much.
